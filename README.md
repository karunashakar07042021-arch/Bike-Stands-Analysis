# 🚲 Bike-Stands-Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

The **Bike Stands Analysis Project** focuses on monitoring and analyzing bike stand **availability, utilization, and distribution** across multiple countries, cities, and stations.

This dashboard converts raw bike-sharing data into **actionable insights** to help city planners and operators:

- Reduce shortages

- Improve service reliability

- Optimize redistribution

- Support data-driven urban mobility decisions 
## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze bike stand utilization vs availability

- Track monthly/seasonal trends

- Compare performance across countries & cities

- Identify top and underperforming stations

- Enable operational optimization using interactive dashboards
##  ❗ Problem Statement

- Urban bike-sharing systems face:

- Uneven bike availability

- Over/underutilized stations

- Seasonal demand spikes

- Poor station-level visibility

- Goal: Efficiently monitor usage to reduce shortages and improve redistribution

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Power BI

- Power Query (Cleaning & Transformation)

- Data Modeling (Star Schema)

- DAX Measures

- Interactive Visualizations

## ✅ Conclusion

The system has **sufficient infrastructure but uneven operations.**
While overall availability is healthy, **localized shortages and seasonal spikes** reduce service reliability.

By applying **predictive analytics, proactive redistribution, and targeted expansion**, bike-sharing efficiency can significantly improve — resulting in **fewer stock-outs, better commuter satisfaction, and smarter urban mobility planning.**
